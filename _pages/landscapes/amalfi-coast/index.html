  <p class="p--lead">The Amalfi Coast – effortlessly photogenic, indelibly charming, precarious in its arrangement and truly romantic.</p>
  <p>The sheer cliffs that sink to the clear waters create a beguiling drama, particularly in the villages and towns that dot the coastline. Precariously clinging to the rocks, technicolour houses form villages that scale the steep slopes, held together by vertical roads and plenty of stairs. They reveal small streets packed with quaint trattorias, boutiques, and impossibly good views. With a chain of towns to explore, each with their own unique flair, the Amalfi Coast offers endless idylls for the perfect Italian break by the sea. Plan your trip below with top tips and hidden gems curated by us, for you.</p>

  - title: Praiano
    class: praiano
    description: A stunning cliff-hugging town that was once the favourite of the Amalfi dukes, Praiano is an Amalfi starlet. With no real centre, it’s a colourful collection of startling white houses, which hide treasures like a flourishing arts scene plus a host of chilled-out bars set in this quiet, serene fishing village.

    class: furore
    hidden-gem: true
    description: Known as the painted town of the Amalfi coast, you’ll find a host of colourful murals dotted all around the village. Its layout is its draw – houses, churches and other buildings are sparsely scattered across the steep hillside, seemingly climbing from sea level right to the sky. The small beach here is stunning, framed by two vast outcrops which form a calm cove that leads out to the sea.

    class: sorrento
    description: Marking the beginning of the Amalfi coast, Sorrento sits facing the bay of Naples, offering views of Vesuvius and excursions to Pompeii and Herculaneum.

  - title: Positano
    class: positano
    description: A precipitously perched town that embodies all the finest Amalfi qualities – technicolour houses, cobbled lamp-lit streets with al fresco dining, boutiques and enotecas, and stupendously steep climbs. A town of steps, effortlessly photogenic, and tiringly charming – a true highlight of this stunning coastline.

  - title: Paestum
    class: paestum
    description: This ancient Greek city is simply breathtaking. A total of three vast temples still stand, dating from around  600 to 450 BC, alongside an amphitheatre, the city walls, paved roads and remnants of other buildings. The remarkable condition of the city is startling and some of the best preserved of the Ancient Greeks.

    hidden-gem: true
    description: There are plenty of famous wine regions in Italy, yet the Amalfi Coast is a true underdog. Alight at this precariously perched vineyard, worth it for the views alone. Tucked high above Furore, not widely-known native grapes like Ripoli, Fenile or Pere Palummo are used to make crisp whites and deep reds, to be tasted in front of breathtaking views.

The iconic striped facade is in the style of the eclectic Sicilian Arabic-Norman influence, whilst the heavy bronze doors were commissioned and shipped-in from Syria. The mainly Baroque interior features 12th and 13th century murals, in a vast, awe-inspiring space.
