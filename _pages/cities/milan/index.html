  - title: San Bernardino Alle Ossa
    class: san-bernardino-alle-ossa
    description: A rather grim, macabre and yet stirringly magnificent arrangement, this ossuary hosts towering walls of bones. Built next to the medieval hospital, the ossuary was designed to deal with the problem of the full graveyard – yet its remarkable interior, with frescoes painted by Sebastiano Ricci in 1695, offer a dramatic and troublingly beautiful sight.

  - title: Leonardo’s Vineyard
    class: leonardo-s-vineyard
    description: Just across the square from where Da Vinci painted The Last Supper, was the accommodation he stayed in during the work. He was here given a small patch to grow grapes to produce his favourite white wine, which, astoundingly, still exists. Tour the house and garden for insight into Leonardo’s stay in Milan – book a Saturday and enjoy an aperitivo on the terrace.

  - title: Villa Invernizzi
    class: villa-invernizzi
    description: As an alternative to Milan’s premiere city park, Parco Sempione, discover this quiet city escape. Decked in lavish Liberty style (Italy’s answer to Art Nouveau), the grounds are equally eccentric, with pink flamingos, peacocks and ducks jostling for space. A perfect retreat for a picnic.

  - title: Wait and See
    class: wait-and-see
    description: In the home of fashion, it’d be ludicrous not to feature some alternative boutiques. For unique, unconventional designs, Wait and See is a treasure trove of womenswear, accessories and handpicked vintage pieces – perfect for staying ahead of the trends.

  - title: Mercatone dell’Antiquariato
    class: mercatone-dell-antiquariato
    description: On the last Sunday of each month, this flea market offers a feast for treasure hunters. Antiques and bric-a-brac, plus the chance to nab some great vintage clothes make this market worth planning your getaway around.

  - title: Casa Galimberti
    class: casa-galimberti
    description: This is one of the finest Liberty designs in Italy. The tiled facade, portraying a colourful, flirtatious host of bourgeois ladies, is a wonder to behold. Meet the cast and stand in awe at the intricacy of the building’s design.

  - title: Enoteca Cotti
    class: enoteca-cotti

  - title: Torrefazione Hodeidah
    class: torrefazione-hodeidah
    description: For the best espresso in town, head to this nostalgic bar – unchanged since first opening in 1946. This time warp hole-in-the-wall is a no-frills pit-stop – alight for espresso, aperitivo, or sweet treats, plus a range of roasts to be bagged and enjoyed at home.

  - title: Pizzeria Spontini
    class: pizzeria-spontini
    description: This stalwart slice spot has been providing cheap eats for locals in the heart of Milan since 1953. Cues can lead out onto the street, such is the draw. It’s cheap and delicious – grab a slice Milanese-style for a much needed pick me up in the heart of the city.

  - title: Antica Trattoria della Pesa
    class: antica-trattoria-della-pesa
    description: This classic Milanese trattoria may be quite well known, but it’s still a local’s favourite and perfect for traditional Milanese eats. Its old-world charms abound, with classic Milanese dishes like cassoeula or foiolo prepared artfully alongside a host of other Italian treats.
